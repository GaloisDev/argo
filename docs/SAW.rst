SAW Verification
================

The SAW API is still in flux and is not yet fully documented.

Methods implemented against the SAW API may throw :ref:`a variety of SAW-related
errors <saw-server-errors>`, with codes in the range of ``10000``-``19999``.
Additionally, SAW verification relies on Cryptol, and some SAW methods may throw
:ref:`Cryptol server errors <cryptol-server-errors>` when appropriate.
