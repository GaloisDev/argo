SAW Verification
================

Note: The SAW API is still in flux and is not yet fully documented.

As with the Cryptol methods, server state is propagated as described in the
protocol overview.

Methods implemented against the SAW API may throw :ref:`a variety of SAW-related
errors <saw-server-errors>`, with codes in the range of ``10000``-``19999``.
Additionally, SAW verification relies on Cryptol, and some SAW methods may throw
:ref:`Cryptol server errors <cryptol-server-errors>` when appropriate.
